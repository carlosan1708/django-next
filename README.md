Django-CRUD with Next JS Frontend

TODO:
- Pass roles and adjust UI screens accordingly
- Include refresh token or similar flow since token expires quite fast. 
- Some overall UI improvements on the table to treat the ingredients better. 

The following code was made in less than a day. It's a fast development that compresses a lot of features and tries to balance best practices, so there will be comments about potential improvements.

This is using https://github.com/juanbenitezdev/django-rest-framework-crud as base and following this tutorial for Next Js.

It has been customized to change the business topic and create adoptions to enable communication. 

Usage: 

docker-compose up

Internal README for each backend and frontend are available.
